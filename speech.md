Greetings, IGN!

My name is Darryl Dixon, and I'm a self-taught web developer from virginia.

I'm promarily a front-end developer but I've also dug into back-end development a bit Node js with Express js.

I started learning web development about 6 and a half months ago. I watched a video on YouTube and followed along to see how to turn a Phototshop PSD into a website using HTML and CSS. From there, and up to now, I have learned enough to build 4 websites from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and I've learned responsive design. I've also made a simple chat app using Express js, and Socket io. It features the ability to join different rooms of your choice.

I really want to intern at IGN because I want to expand my knowledge and I feel that learning from industry professionals is the best way to achieve this. Not only that but me being a gamer, an environment based around video game media would be the perfect place for me.

That said I would be forever grateful for the opportunity to be apart of this awesome internship at IGN.
